# Fast Blood  :hospital:

## Client-side tracking mechanism for rare or type specific blood products

## [ :arrow_forward: DEMO ON HEROKU](https://infinite-ridge-56322.herokuapp.com/)

## Problem :question:
#### At times medical staff have limited understanding of the difficulties in finding rare units of blood, particularly in clinically urgent situations. This app is to help the understanding and communication between blood providers, transfusion laboratories, clinicians, and patients.

## Solution :hammer_and_wrench: 
#### A plugin application medical staff can view  independently from any client-side workbench. This frees up the medical staff to carry on with other responsibilities while still being able to check the status of their testing and blood products for specific patients. 

## The Plugin :electric_plug:
#### THe app will calculate the amount of time it takes to process all testing and products ordered and display the estimated completion time. The plugin application will also allow  medical staff to view the progress of each part that of testing that is complete as well as the reason why their testing  or search for rare or type sepcific blood may be taking longer than anticipated.
